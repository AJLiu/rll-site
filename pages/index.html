The Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab(GTRLL) performs fundamental and applied research in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics with a focus on developing theory and systems that tightly integrate perception, learning, and control. Our work touches on a range of problems including computer vision, system identification, forecasting, simultaneous localization & mapping, imitation learning, motion planning, and optimal control. The algorithms that we develop often use and extend theory from matrix and tensor algebra, nonparametric statistics, deep neural networks, non-convex optimization, online learning, and dynamic programming.

We are located on the third floor of the College of Computing.
