        <p>The Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab(GTRLL) performs fundamental and applied research in machine 
            learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics with a focus on developing theory and systems 
            that tightly integrate perception, learning, and control. Our work touches on a range of problems 
            including computer vision, system identification, forecasting, simultaneous localization and mapping, 
            imitation learning, motion planning, and optimal control. The algorithms that we develop often use 
            and extend theory from matrix and tensor algebra, nonparametric statistics, deep neural networks, 
            non-convex optimization, online learning, and dynamic programming.
