title: Large-Scale Gaussian Process Learning
year: 2017
term: Fall
members:
    - Byron Boots,
    - Ching-An Cheng,
summary: While Gaussian processes have been considered as a universal approximator, their applications are limited by the accompanying superlinear complexity. In this project, we exploit the connection between Gaussian processes and reproducing kernel Hilbert space to design adaptive algorithms for efficient large-scale learning.
