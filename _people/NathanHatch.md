title: Nathan Hatch - Robot Learning Lab
name: Nathan Hatch
bio: I began the Georgia Tech CS PhD program in Fall 2017. Prior to that, I worked for three years as a software engineer at eSpark Learning, an education technology startup company in Chicago. I got my double B.S. in mathematics and computer science from the University of Chicago in 2014. My as-yet-unformed research interests lie somewhere between theoretical ML, deep learning, and applications of ML to socially relevant problems.
