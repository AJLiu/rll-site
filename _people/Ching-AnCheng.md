title: Ching-An Cheng - Robot Learning Lab
name: Ching-An Cheng
bio: My research builds on the intersection between machine learning and control with special focus on robotic systems. I am interested in theories and algorithms that consider uncertainties and constraints in real-world applications. Particularly, my current research topics include (deep) reinforcement/imitation learning, Gaussian processes, and kernel methods.
