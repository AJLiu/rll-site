title: Mustafa Mukadam - Robot Learning Lab
name: Mustafa Mukadam
bio: Mustafa Mukadam is a PhD Robotics student at Georgia Tech being advised by Dr. Byron Boots and a member of the Georgia Tech Robot Learning Lab that is a part of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines. He also collaborates with Dr. Frank Dellaert and Dr. Sonia Chernova. <br/> His research is at the confluence of many areas of robotics like, motion planning, controls, estimation and learning from demonstration and often employ probabilistic and machine learning tools. <br/> Before starting his PhD, he completed a masters in Aerospace Engineering with a focus in robotics from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where he worked on manipulation planning for deformable linear objects under Dr. Timothy Bretl.
