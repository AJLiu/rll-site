title: Brian Hrolenok - Robot Learning Lab
name: Brian Hrolenok
bio: I am a PhD candidate at the School of Interactive Computing, part of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. I research modeling collective behavior in multiagent systems using machine learning. In particular, I've studied methods for building executable models of behavior from tracking data for groups of bees, fish, ants, and monkeys. <br/> I have previously worked in the Autonomous Robotics Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science, part of the Volgenau School of Engineering at George Mason University, where I obtained my BS and MS in Computer Science.
